    <h3>ABOUT ME. </h3>
    <P>
    My name is Hussein Sadam Farhan. I am a graduate from Kenyatta University. I pursued marine science. I pursued my secondary school at Moi High School. My primary school was Plainsview Academy. I excelled very well in all my school levels. My passion for science is enormous especially about marine life.
    </p>
    <p>I decide to take the programming classes at Moringa school because studying programming languages will help me  make money, and be happy, more fulfilled and more informed citizen. It will also add my career choices and I will be more marketable unlike my peers. Moreover, I love challenging myself to gain new knowledge so as to be well informed.
    </p>
    <p>I am a sociable person who loves making new friends. I am also an avid rugby and football fan. I also love playing playstation specifically  FIFA. I also love politics and may be someday I will be a politician. Watching fictional movies is something I also do during my free time.
